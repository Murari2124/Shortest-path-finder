# Shortest-path-finder
This project is about finding shortest distance between two cities using Dijkestra algorithm.
In this project the program allows you to give input (city1,city2, distance between them) and forms a graph.
Then program will ask you to give city of departure and destination city.
Then the program will give then shortest distance between those cities, path to be followed and approximate cost of diesel for the entire journey.
